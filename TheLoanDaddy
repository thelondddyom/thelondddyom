Borrowers are now expected to save more than $75 million per year, which can be reinvested in communities to strengthen local economies.

The reform honors the will of Ohio voters, who overwhelmingly supported a law passed in 2008 to rein in payday lending. But instead of getting licenses under that law, lenders registered as brokers, which enabled them to charge unlimited fees—leaving Ohio’s payday loan customers with far fewer protections, and paying much higher prices, than those in other states.

In the years leading up to the passage of the Fairness in Lending Act, six payday loan chains in Ohio controlled more than 90 percent of the market. Many consumers paid more in fees than they originally received in credit, and loans often took up more than a third of their paychecks.
